Predictive modeling using CNN to correctly detect traffic signs

Traffic signs come in different colors, shapes, in form of pictures and are easy to understand. They represent rules that keep us safe, and help communicate messages to drivers and pedestrians. Itâ€™s important to know what each picture represents. Failing to do so could result in serious accidents or fine.

Computer vision is advancing rapidly with the help of Deep Learning which plays an important role in driver-assistance systems and driverless operations to detect other cars and objects on the roads to avoid collision. Equally important for these driverless vehicles is to recognize traffic signs under different traffic and lighting conditions, day and night. Being able to correctly recognize the traffic signs ensures road safety, avoid breaking traffic laws and collisions, and finally contributes to the success of the cause.
